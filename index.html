        Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is widely considered as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[2] Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music.
